# Hello world!

I am currently at my senior year studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/). I work primarily on my thesis on "Resumption Monad Transformers and their Applications in the Semantics of Concurrency" under the supervision of Professor [Nikolaos Papaspyrou](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~nickie/).

I grew up in Kalamata, a sleepy beach town in Greece. My name is Georgios (Greek) but you can also call me George.

# What do I Do

Nowadays, I work mainly on my thesis while also doing an internship at [PwC Greece](https://www.pwc.com/gr/en.html). Additionally, I am studying about automated program synthesis, as I am particularly interested in radically simplifing programming and making it accessible to all users.

My main research interests therefore revolve around the fascinating field of the theory and implementation of Programming Languages and I am specifically interested in the areas of Program Analysis and Program Synthesis.
