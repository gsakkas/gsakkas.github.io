## _**Update**_ I am on the industry job market! I am looking for research or software engineering positions on program synthesis, program repair, LLM code generation, intelligent coding assistants etc. to start October 2024.

# About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) (CSE) department at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), where I conduct research in [Programming Languages](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) with my advisor Prof. [Ranjit Jhala](http://ranjitjhala.github.io/). My current research focuses on developing tools that make software development, programming, and debugging easier. Specifically, I work on Automated Program Repair and Synthesis, aiming to create fast and reliable tools by combining traditional Programming Languages (PL) research with state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies on [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), where I also worked on my thesis on "Resumption Monad Transformers and their Applications in the Semantics of Concurrency" under the supervision of Prof. [Nikolaos Papaspyrou](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~nickie/).

My name is Georgios or Yiorgos (Greek: *Γεώργιος* or *Γιώργος*) but you can also call me George. I grew up in [Kalamata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamata), a sleepy beach town in Greece. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball or going out with friends. I also occasionally do some oil painting and drawing.
