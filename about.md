# About Me

I am currently at my senior year studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/). I am mainly working on my thesis on "Resumption Monad Transformers and their Applications in the Semantics of Concurrency" under the supervision of Professor [Nikolaos Papaspyrou](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~nickie/).

My main research interests revolve around the fascinating field of the theory and implementation Programming Languages. I am specifically interested in the areas of Program Analysis and Program Synthesis.
