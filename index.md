# About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) (CSE) department at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), where I work on my research on [Programming Languages](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) with my advisor Prof. [Ranjit Jhala](http://ranjitjhala.github.io/). My current research interests focus on building tools that make software development, programming and debugging easier. In that end, I work on Automated Program Repair and Synthesis to build fast and reliable tools drawing inspiration from traditional Programming Languages (PL) research and state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) approaches.

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies on [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), where I also worked on my thesis on "Resumption Monad Transformers and their Applications in the Semantics of Concurrency" under the supervision of Prof. [Nikolaos Papaspyrou](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~nickie/).

My name is Georgios or Yiorgos (Greek: *Γεώργιος* or *Γιώργος*) but you can also call me George. I grew up in [Kalamata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamata), a sleepy beach town in Greece. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball or hanging out with friends. Sometimes, I also do some oil painting or drawing.
