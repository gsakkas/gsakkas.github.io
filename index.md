# About Me

I am a PhD student in the [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) (CSE) department at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), where I work on my research on [Programming Languages](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) with my advisor [Prof. Ranjit Jhala](http://ranjitjhala.github.io/). My current research interests focus on building tools that make software development, programming and debugging easier. In that end, I work on Automated Program Repair and Synthesis to build fast and reliable tools drawing inspiration from traditional Programming Languages (PL) research and state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) approaches.

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies on [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), where I also worked on my thesis on "Resumption Monad Transformers and their Applications in the Semantics of Concurrency" under the supervision of Professor [Nikolaos Papaspyrou](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~nickie/).

My name is Georgios or Yiorgos (Greek: *Γεώργιος* or *Γιώργος*) but you can also call me George. I grew up in Kalamata, a sleepy beach town in Greece. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball or hanging out with friends. Sometimes, I also do some oil painting or drawing.

<!-- Nowadays, I work mainly on my thesis and recently I finished an internship at [PwC Greece](https://www.pwc.com/gr/en.html). Additionally, I am studying about automated program synthesis, as I am particularly interested in radically simplifing programming and making it accessible to all users. I am also trying to implement my own tool for inductive program synthesis from input-output examples, using neural networks to speed up the search process over the program state space.

My main research interests revolve around the fascinating field of the theory and implementation of Programming Languages and I am specifically interested in the areas of Program Analysis and Program Synthesis. I love working on projects about those topics with my friends and fellow students, and integrating knowledge from various CS fields into these projects. -->
